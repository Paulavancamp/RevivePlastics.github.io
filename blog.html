    <h3 class = title>Semester Collection Review</h3>
      <p>There are always numbers being tossed around when people discuss recycling.  91% of recyclables end up in landfills.  15% of what is recycled is actually trash. 150 million tons of plastic produced each year is used only once…the list goes on. Well after piloting our collection for Revive, we have numbers of our own, and they’re definitely more positive than the rest. 
<br>
6 Volunteers, for 8 hours across 3 weeks, in 1 building, collected 329 pieces of plastic! Of the plastic collected, 206 were type #1, 20 were type #2, and 103 were type #5.  If you’re curious how we could accumulate so much, some of the items included: 
<br>
•	Water Bottles<br>
•	Gatorade Bottles<br>
•	Colored Party Cups<br>
•	Yogurt containers<br>
•	Cleaning Supplies<br>
•	Film/packaging<br>
•	Starbucks cups<br>
<br>
The job was not easy or fun (okay, maybe a little fun) but it was definitely worthwhile. Big shout out to Katie Tooher, Darren Garcia, Parker Dow, Alex Vonderhaar, Jenelle Lee, and Emma Hudson-Mariet for their willingness to get their hands dirty and dig through the recycling in the heat of the 707 basement. Couldn’t have done it without you! </p>

<p>
We will be back next semester with more to learn and many ways to get involved. If you are around this summer and want to help reach out to join the summer crew. We will meet a few times early on to plan activities for the fall and then gear up later in the summer to test the machines and set up the work space.  The meetings will most likely be on weekends or after work hours so anyone with a summer job can attend.  
<br><br>
Thanks for tuning in!

    <h3 class = title>Earth Week!</h3>
      <p>It’s earth week and there are so many ways to celebrate. Although, sustainability is advertised as a way to reduce your negative impact, it is also about creating a positive impact. “Going green” can be cutting out waste, driving less, using reusable bags, etc. – most of the things we’ve discussed this semester- and planting trees, starting a new beehive, cleaning up trash, etc.  Before Earth Week comes to a close, there are still many opportunities to create some positive change and connect with eco-organizations.  Below are a few FREE events for this weekend: </p>

  <br>Revive Update:</b>
In other news, the temperature is rising, and so is our budget! Two weeks ago, Revive took 2nd place in the Brewed Ideas Challenge within the Social Venture track.  We now have an extra $2,000 in funding to purchase our recycling machines.  Thank you to everyone who came to show your support.  We are closer than ever before, but still need a boost to cover the full cost.  We will be selling stickers (of the logo shown below) for $1 to anyone who is interested in supporting Revive and spreading the name to more people.  Stop me (Paula) next time we cross paths or send me a text at (314)-249-4415 to get yours.

    <h3 class = title>Recycle Across America</h3>
      <p>
        Tax day is coming up! That’s right, it’s Monday April 15th.  Yes, I know what you’re thinking “This has nothing to do with recycling”. Hear me out.  For some people, this time of year means pulling more money out of our wallets, but for others it means earning back some decent pocket change.  Do you have plans for that tax return? If not, consider setting some aside for a good cause…(you see where this is going now?)
</p>
 <p>       <a href="https://www.recycleacrossamerica.org/more-about-label-donation-program">Recycle Across America</a> (RAA) is a nonprofit that focuses on standardizing waste bins in schools and organizations – including Walt Disney World - in order to reduce confusion and increase education surrounding recycling.  We’ve all suffered from the inconsistencies in colors, labels, and symbols on waste bins.  Deciding where to put your used napkin and where to put your empty soda can is especially confusing here at Marquette. RAA focuses on distributing clearly labeled, standard bins that have the potential to save recycling.</p>
    <img src="insert recycling bin pic">
 <p>
According to RAA, “When U.S recycling levels reach 75% it will be the environmental and CO2 equivalent of removing 55 million cars from U.S roads each year.” Let’s try to make it happen! So if you’re wondering what to do with your tax return and you’re feeling generous, put it towards educating future generations of recyclers!

    <h3 class = title>Consumer Waste</h3>
      <p>
        You know what’s better than recycling your waste? Reducing the amount you produce in the first place! We’ve all heard the expression “reduce, reuse, recycle” and there is a reason they are in that order.  Recycling, as we’ve established the last few weeks, is not very efficient in it’s current state.  But there are many ways to cut down on disposable materials and reduce the need for better recycling.  What’s better, is that reducing your waste can actually save you money! Here are some suggestions on how to eliminate unnecessary trash and save money (Some list items adopted from the <a href="https://thefinancialdiet.com/7-zero-waste-habits-that-are-secretly-unneccessary-money-wasters/">Financial Diet)</a></p>
<p>

<br>  <b class=green>•	Transition to Tupperware:</b> Ziplock bags and plastic wrap are the gold-medalists of convenience.  However they are single-use plastic items that add up quickly.  Try purchasing a set of mason jars or plastic containers to keep around for leftovers and bagged lunches.<br>
<br>  <b class=blu>•	B.Y.O.Bag:</b> One of the easiest ways to cut down on plastic, but the hardest to remember.  If you have a car, leave a few reusable bags in the trunk so you are always prepared.  In the times that you do forget a bag and you’re making a small purchase, simply ask for no bag once you check out!
  <br>
 <br> <b class=orn>•	Purchase in Person:</b> Items purchased online or from large department stores are normally wrapped with unnecessary packaging.  Also, there is an increase in CO2 emissions from the delivery services.  If you need some retail therapy, hop on a bus or take a walk to some shops with locally made goods. You will be able to eliminate waste form packaging, save money on shipping, AND support the community.  Below are some locations that sell handmade goods from local vendors/artists:<br>
  o	Gifts and Apparel – <a href="http://sparrowcollective.com/">Sparrow Collective</a><br>
  o	Home goods and Apparel –<a href="https://thewaxwing.com/"> The Waxwing</a><br>
  o	Plants and home goods – <a href="http://www.modgenmke.com/">Mod Gen</a><br>
  o	Apothecary and Boutique - <a href="https://www.shopursa.com/">URSA</a><br>
<br>  <b class=purp >•	Go for the Glass:</b> Next time you’re out at a bar, go for a glass on tap rather than a bottle/can from their fridge.  Or if you’re at a coffee shop to study, be sure to tell them it’s “for here” so your drink is served in a cup or mug. Most places will actually give a small discount if you bring your own thermos or request it in a mug!
  </p>

<p>
If you’re already practicing a lot of these habits and want something more “extreme”, check out <a href="https://colinbeavan.com/search-no-impact/">The No Impact Man.</a>  It is an account of a man who eliminates his waste and carbon footprint completely over the course of a year.  The book is so much more than saving the planet.  It is a reflection on the time and energy we waste within the consumer society, and how leaving the material world behind can bring us closer together.

    <h3 class = title>Save the Earth by Shopping</h3>
      <p>Are you ready for the not-so-fun fact of the day?  This January, China stopped accepting United States recycling.  Whether you were aware we sent it to them in the first place or if this is news to you, it’s a <b>big</b> deal.  Our material processing facilities are not prepared to handle the amount of recyclable waste we produce.  Some cities don’t even have facilities to process recyclables, so they have stopped their programs completely - sending all their waste to landfills.
    </p><br>
<p>
In order to support the systems in place and keep them from shutting down, we need to keep buying products made from recycled materials.  This will maintain/increase the demand for recycled plastic and allow recycling facilities to stay in business! <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/business/local-recycling-costs.html"> Click here</a> to read more about this change.  Here are some common items that you could consider buying from companies that use recycled plastic in their products!</p><br>
    <p>
•	Shopping for new apparel or shoes?  Try buying from the <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/parley?clickId=3Qozd3wfvxyJT0o08lQuCVrSUkl2hdwn3z2r200&cm_mmc=AdieAffiliates_IR-_-Skimbit%20Ltd.-_-Online%20Tracking%20Link-_-ONLINE_TRACKING_LINK-_-&cm_mmc2=adidas-NA-eCom-Affiliates-_-Skimbit%20Ltd.-_-None-None-US-always-on-None-1801&irgwc=1">Adidas Parley line</a> that focuses on diverting plastic from oceans<br>
•	Or maybe you’re a bigger fan of the North Face.  You can buy from their <a href="https://www.thenorthface.com/featured/bottle-source.html">Bottle Source line</a> which uses plastic collected from national parks! <br>
•	Spring is here and the sun is shining.  Can’t find your sunglasses? Invest in a pair from <a href="https://www.sea2see.org/pages/sustainability">sea2see</a>.  They make optical frames too 😊<br>
      •	Looking for a new water bottle?  Try the amazing <a href="https://drinksoma.com/pages/sustainability">Soma bottle</a> made from plastic and bamboo <br>
•	There are endless options! <span class=purp>Next time you need to make a purchase see if there is a more sustainable alternative first.</span>

    <h3 class = title>102 Ton Legacy</h3>
      <p>
        This week, we are talking trash.  According to Edward Humes, Author of Garbology, “Americans make more trash than anyone else on the planet, throwing away about 7.1 pounds per person per day, 365 days a year.”  This equates to a total of 102 TONS of trash in their lifetime.  That is the weight of 15 adult elephants… </p><br>
<p>
Do you think about the amount of waste you produce on a daily basis? Probably not; nobody really has time for that. Thanks to a study done by Columbia University, we have a better understanding of where the mass amounts of waste end up.  The research shows that 69.3% of  total municipal solid waste is sent to landfills, 24.1% is sent to recycling facilities, and 6.7% is converted to energy (“The state of Garbage in America”, BioCycle, October 2010).  <a href="http://www.edwardhumes.com/garbology">(click here to read more)</a>
  </p><br>
  <p>
    As a team, <span class=blu>Revive</span> is setting out to gather some data of our own … and we need your help! Starting in April, we will be sorting through bags of recyclables to find out how much plastic we will be capable of repurposing on campus.  This work will not be glamorous by any means, however the facilities department has been extremely helpful in getting a space set up for us with tables, bins, and sanitary gloves (because who knows what we’ll find).  We will keep track of weight and items found to gain an understanding our recycling stream.

    <h3 class = title>Plastic by the Numbers</h3>
    <p>Spring Break is a great time to get organized and sort some things out.  I don't mean cleaning out your backpack or sorting through papers from this semester, I'm talking about plastic! Did you know that Marquette only accepts plastic types #1, #2, #4, and #5? 
<br>
YES.  Only 4 different types are accepted even though many of the bins advertise that we accept all plastics #1-#7!  False advertising and confusing branding makes recycling complicated and mistakes causes a lot of problems down the line... 
<br>
The good news is that our REVIVE Machines will be able to process all of these types (1,2,4,and 5)! With enough people to help collect, sort, and clean, we could potentially offset all the plastic that would have been sent away.  
<br>
When you get back from spring break, we will be trying out the collection process to see what is really happening on campus.  Stay tuned for details about when this will begin.  In the mean time, happy spring break and good luck sorting :)
