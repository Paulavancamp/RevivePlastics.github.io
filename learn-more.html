		<h1 class=purp>Why Recycle?</h1>
		<p> Learn about [some] of the reasons recycling is so important.  Informaiton gathered from the 
			<a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle">EPA</a> and <a href="https://www.kab.org/resources/improve-recycling">Keep America Beautiful </a>
			 :)

  <div class = energy>
<h2><span class=purp>Recycling saves energy</span></h2>
		<p>Conservation of energy is the key element for the fight against climate change. 
			Recycling saves energy because the manufacturer doesn’t have to produce 
			something new from raw natural resources. By using recycled materials we 
			save on energy consumption, which keeps production costs down.
		</p>
  </div>
  <div class = space>
<h2><span class=blu> Saves Space in Landfils</span></h2>
		<p>Recycling reduces the need for more landfills because we are able to reduce
			the amount of material filling them.  Recyclable materials like glass
			and plastic can take hundreds of years to break down which means the landfils
			will continue to grow.  
		</p>
  </div>
   <div class = concervation>
  <h2><span class=purp> Recycling conserves natural materials </span></h2>
		<p> Recycling helps conserve important natural materials and protects these habitats for 
			the future. All the new products are made from raw materials which are procured 
			from harvesting the earth’s natural resources. E.g. paper and wooden products are 
			cut from trees.
		</p>
  </div>
  <div class = economy>
<h2><span class=orn> Recycling is good for the economy </span></h2>
		<p>Greater demand, means greater supply.  Recycling and purchasing recycled products creates 
			a greater demand for more recycled goods. Goods made from recycled materials use less 
			water, creates less pollution and uses less energy. Companies rely on recycling programs 
			to provide the raw materials they need to make new products.
		</p>
  </div>
  <div class = money>
<h2><span class=green> Recycling saves you money </span></h2>
		<p>When you recycle or repurpose old products and have less dependency on new products 
			and containers. We like to reuse our bottles for homemade cold-pressed juices. 
			Check with your local food trucks or cafes, some of them may encourage the use 
			of bringing in your own bowl or container and credit you. The same with bringing
			your own shopping bag to your local grocery shop.
		</p>
 
  </div>
  <div class = mindfulness> 
   <h2><span class=blu>Increases mindfulness</span> </h2>
		<p>Each time you place recycleables in a recycling bin - as opposed to the trash can - 
			you are making an intentional choice. As you continue to practice, you begin to 
			notice others also recycling (or not). By being aware of our consumption of recyclable 
			products and how we’re sorting for waste will flow into other areas of your life where 
			you may be wasting time or energy carelessly.

	<h1 class=green> You are not alone! </h1>
	<p> If you have your doubts about recycling, it's safe to say a large percentage of people feel the same.  A study in 2017 done 
		Keep America Beautiful shows that not everyone is confident that their recyclables are handled the way they should be.
