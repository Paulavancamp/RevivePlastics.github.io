		  <h1 class=purp>Our Story</h1>
    <p>Revive began with a little curiosity and a lot of time on YouTube.  
	    Specifically, curiosity about the recycling process and videos about just that. 
	    Paula Van Camp stumbled upon an online platform with small-scale recycling machine blueprints <a href = "https://preciousplastic.com/">(Precious Plastic)</a> and was instantly inspired to take action.  
	    
	    With the expression "think global, act local" in mind, Paula thought of bringing some of these machines to Marquette.  
	    
	    She reached out to a good friend and fellow student, Colleen Dunlap for help.  
	    Together, they started building connections to bring a plastic recycling workshop to campus. 
	    
	    <br>With the help of the 707 Hub, the two started to transform a half-baked idea into a full fledged business proposition. 
	    Their idea began gaining a lot of traction in the community and took 2nd place for Social Innovation in the
	    <a href="https://www.marquette.edu/707-hub/brewed-ideas-challenge.php">Brewed Ideas Challenge</a> to earn funding for the recycling machines.
    <br> One year after the initial idea, and the team is knee-deep in plastic from campus collections and ready to make a difference. </p>

    <h1 class=green>How it works</h1>
    <p id=Step1><span class=purp>Step 1: Collect</span>
      <br>The collection process begins the moment you (yes YOU!) toss your recyclable plastic item in the recycling bins on campus. The facility team then sets aside the bags for the Revive team to sort through! </p>
  <p id=Step2><span class=orn>Step 2: Sort</span>
    <br>After it's been collected, plastic is sorted by type and only types &#9843; &#9844; &#9846; &#9847; are kept to use.  The remaining plastic, aluminum, paper, and glass is returned to recycling bags for other facilities to process.  As we sort, extra parts (like bottle caps) and labels are removed to make the cleaning process easier.</p>
   <p id=Step3><span class=blu>Step 3: Clean</span>
     <br>Next, all materials are cleaned from food/liquid contamination. Soft soap and water are used rather than harsh chemicals to avoid toxins and environmental contamination - and to cut down on $$.  </p>
    <p id=Step4><span class=green>Step 4: Shred</span>
      <br>At this point the plastic is ready to be refined into small, usable flakes. A special machine is used to tear the solid materials into smaller pieces.</p>
    <p id=Step5><span class=red>Step 5: Inject</span>
      <br>Plasic shreds are sent through a machine that melts the plastics and injects them into solid molds.</p>
   <p id=Step6><span class=purp>Step 6: Sell</span>
     <br>Finally, the plastics are re-introduced into the Marquette and Milwaukee community to be used again (and again, and again...)</p>

	<h1 class=green> Meet The Team</h1>
	<p>Revive would not be possible without the dedicated team members.  Together, they work to educate others about the realities of recycling
	through communication and events.  They spend time making sure individuals are safe and productive in the Revive workspace. 
	They are eahc committed to sustainability and proud to be part of the project. </p>
