    	<h3 class = title>Semester Collection Review</h3>
      	<p>There are always numbers being tossed around when people discuss recycling.  91% of recyclables end up in landfills.  15% of what is recycled is actually trash. 150 million tons of plastic produced each year is used only once…the list goes on. Well after piloting our collection for Revive, we have numbers of our own, and they’re definitely more positive than the rest. 
	      <br>6 Volunteers, for 8 hours across 3 weeks, in 1 building, collected 329 pieces of plastic! Of the plastic collected, 206 were type #1, 20 were type #2, and 103 were type #5.  If you’re curious how we could accumulate so much, some of the items included: 
        <br>
•	Water Bottles<br>
•	Gatorade Bottles<br>
•	Colored Party Cups<br>
•	Yogurt containers<br>
•	Cleaning Supplies<br>
•	Film/packaging<br>
•	Starbucks cups<br>
<br>
The job was not easy or fun (okay, maybe a little fun) but it was definitely worthwhile. Big shout out to Katie Tooher, Darren Garcia, Parker Dow, Alex Vonderhaar, Jenelle Lee, and Emma Hudson-Mariet for their willingness to get their hands dirty and dig through the recycling in the heat of the 707 basement. Couldn’t have done it without you! </p>

We will be back next semester with more to learn and many ways to get involved. If you are around this summer and want to help reach out to join the summer crew. We will meet a few times early on to plan activities for the fall and then gear up later in the summer to test the machines and set up the work space.  The meetings will most likely be on weekends or after work hours so anyone with a summer job can attend.

Thanks for tuning in!
