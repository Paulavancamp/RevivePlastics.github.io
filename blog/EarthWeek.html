    <h3 class = title>Earth Week!</h3>
      <p>It’s earth week and there are so many ways to celebrate. Although, sustainability is advertised as a way to reduce your negative impact, it is also about creating a positive impact. “Going green” can be cutting out waste, driving less, using reusable bags, etc. – most of the things we’ve discussed this semester- and planting trees, starting a new beehive, cleaning up trash, etc.  Before Earth Week comes to a close, there are still many opportunities to create some positive change and connect with eco-organizations.  Below are a few FREE events for this weekend: </p>

  <br>Revive Update:</b>
In other news, the temperature is rising, and so is our budget! Two weeks ago, Revive took 2nd place in the Brewed Ideas Challenge within the Social Venture track.  We now have an extra $2,000 in funding to purchase our recycling machines.  Thank you to everyone who came to show your support.  We are closer than ever before, but still need a boost to cover the full cost.  We will be selling stickers (of the logo shown below) for $1 to anyone who is interested in supporting Revive and spreading the name to more people.  Stop me (Paula) next time we cross paths or send me a text at (314)-249-4415 to get yours.
