    <h3 class = title>Recycle Across America</h3>
      <p>
        Tax day is coming up! That’s right, it’s Monday April 15th.  Yes, I know what you’re thinking “This has nothing to do with recycling”. Hear me out.  For some people, this time of year means pulling more money out of our wallets, but for others it means earning back some decent pocket change.  Do you have plans for that tax return? If not, consider setting some aside for a good cause…(you see where this is going now?)
</p>
 <p>       <a href="https://www.recycleacrossamerica.org/more-about-label-donation-program">Recycle Across America</a> (RAA) is a nonprofit that focuses on standardizing waste bins in schools and organizations – including Walt Disney World - in order to reduce confusion and increase education surrounding recycling.  We’ve all suffered from the inconsistencies in colors, labels, and symbols on waste bins.  Deciding where to put your used napkin and where to put your empty soda can is especially confusing here at Marquette. RAA focuses on distributing clearly labeled, standard bins that have the potential to save recycling.</p>

According to RAA, “When U.S recycling levels reach 75% it will be the environmental and CO2 equivalent of removing 55 million cars from U.S roads each year.” Let’s try to make it happen! So if you’re wondering what to do with your tax return and you’re feeling generous, put it towards educating future generations of recyclers!
