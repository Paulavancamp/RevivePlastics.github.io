      <p>Are you ready for the not-so-fun fact of the day?  This January, China stopped accepting United States recycling.  Whether you were aware we sent it to them in the first place or if this is news to you, itâ€™s a <b>big</b> deal.  Our material processing facilities are not prepared to handle the amount of recyclable waste we produce.  Some cities donâ€™t even have facilities to process recyclables, so they have stopped their programs completely - sending all their waste to landfills.
    </p><br>
<p>
In order to support the systems in place and keep them from shutting down, we need to keep buying products made from recycled materials.  This will maintain/increase the demand for recycled plastic and allow recycling facilities to stay in business! <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/business/local-recycling-costs.html"> Click here</a> to read more about this change.  Here are some common items that you could consider buying from companies that use recycled plastic in their products!</p><br>
