    <h3 class = title>102 Ton Legacy</h3>
      <p>
        This week, we are talking trash.  According to Edward Humes, Author of Garbology, “Americans make more trash than anyone else on the planet, throwing away about 7.1 pounds per person per day, 365 days a year.”  This equates to a total of 102 TONS of trash in their lifetime.  That is the weight of 15 adult elephants… </p><br>

Do you think about the amount of waste you produce on a daily basis? Probably not; nobody really has time for that. Thanks to a study done by Columbia University, we have a better understanding of where the mass amounts of waste end up.  The research shows that 69.3% of  total municipal solid waste is sent to landfills, 24.1% is sent to recycling facilities, and 6.7% is converted to energy (“The state of Garbage in America”, BioCycle, October 2010).  <a href="http://www.edwardhumes.com/garbology">(click here to read more)</a>

    As a team, <span class=blu>Revive</span> is setting out to gather some data of our own … and we need your help! Starting in April, we will be sorting through bags of recyclables to find out how much plastic we will be capable of repurposing on campus.  This work will not be glamorous by any means, however the facilities department has been extremely helpful in getting a space set up for us with tables, bins, and sanitary gloves (because who knows what we’ll find).  We will keep track of weight and items found to gain an understanding our recycling stream.
