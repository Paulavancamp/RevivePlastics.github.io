        You know what’s better than recycling your waste? Reducing the amount you produce in the first place! We’ve all heard the expression “reduce, reuse, recycle” and there is a reason they are in that order.  Recycling, as we’ve established the last few weeks, is not very efficient in it’s current state.  But there are many ways to cut down on disposable materials and reduce the need for better recycling.  What’s better, is that reducing your waste can actually save you money! Here are some suggestions on how to eliminate unnecessary trash and save money (Some list items adopted from the <a href="https://thefinancialdiet.com/7-zero-waste-habits-that-are-secretly-unneccessary-money-wasters/">Financial Diet)</a></p>
<p>
<br>  <b class=green>•	Transition to Tupperware:</b> Ziplock bags and plastic wrap are the gold-medalists of convenience.  However they are single-use plastic items that add up quickly.  Try purchasing a set of mason jars or plastic containers to keep around for leftovers and bagged lunches.<br>
<br>  <b class=blu>•	B.Y.O.Bag:</b> One of the easiest ways to cut down on plastic, but the hardest to remember.  If you have a car, leave a few reusable bags in the trunk so you are always prepared.  In the times that you do forget a bag and you’re making a small purchase, simply ask for no bag once you check out!
  <br>
 <br> <b class=orn>•	Purchase in Person:</b> Items purchased online or from large department stores are normally wrapped with unnecessary packaging.  Also, there is an increase in CO2 emissions from the delivery services.  If you need some retail therapy, hop on a bus or take a walk to some shops with locally made goods. You will be able to eliminate waste form packaging, save money on shipping, AND support the community.  Below are some locations that sell handmade goods from local vendors/artists:<br>
  o	Gifts and Apparel – <a href="http://sparrowcollective.com/">Sparrow Collective</a><br>
  o	Home goods and Apparel –<a href="https://thewaxwing.com/"> The Waxwing</a><br>
  o	Plants and home goods – <a href="http://www.modgenmke.com/">Mod Gen</a><br>
  o	Apothecary and Boutique - <a href="https://www.shopursa.com/">URSA</a><br>
<br>  <b class=purp >•	Go for the Glass:</b> Next time you’re out at a bar, go for a glass on tap rather than a bottle/can from their fridge.  Or if you’re at a coffee shop to study, be sure to tell them it’s “for here” so your drink is served in a cup or mug. Most places will actually give a small discount if you bring your own thermos or request it in a mug!

If you’re already practicing a lot of these habits and want something more “extreme”, check out <a href="https://colinbeavan.com/search-no-impact/">The No Impact Man.</a>  It is an account of a man who eliminates his waste and carbon footprint completely over the course of a year.  The book is so much more than saving the planet.  It is a reflection on the time and energy we waste within the consumer society, and how leaving the material world behind can bring us closer together.
